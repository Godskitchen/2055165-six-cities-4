Wood and stone place	This is a place for dreamers to reset, reflect, and create. Designed with a 'slow' pace in mind, our hope is that you enjoy every part of your stay; from making local coffee by drip in the morning, choosing the perfect record to put on as the sun sets.	2021-05-30T19:17:34.965Z	Amsterdam	preview-image-1.jpg	offer-image-6.jpg;offer-image-7.jpg;offer-image-2.jpg;offer-image-3.jpg;offer-image-8.jpg;offer-image-4.jpg	false	true	3.4	room	2	2	84766	Baby seat;Air conditioning;Breakfast;Towels;Laptop;Washer	Joel	lawl@rofl.org	user-avatar-4.jpg	обычный	4.9099759999999995	51.243402
